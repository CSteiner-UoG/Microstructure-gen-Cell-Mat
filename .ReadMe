The script titled Microstructure to Model will generate a microstructure and then immediately convert it into a model to be imported into Abaqus.
If you want the processes to remain seperate, the microstructure generator will export a NumPy array that can be imported into the Gmsh Meshing script.
The Gmsh Meshing script will then export a .step file of the model to be brought into Abaqus.
